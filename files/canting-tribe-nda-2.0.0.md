Information, unless the disclosure breached a confidentiality obligation
to Disclosing Party that Disclosing Party made known to Receiving Party.

Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall bear the burden
of proving independent development using contemporaneous documentary
evidence.

> Purpose; and

> Party that impose confidentiality obligations, affording as much or
> more protection as those of this agreement, that apply to the
> Confidential Information; and

professional rules (“**Advisers**”).

> (c)**Limited Use**. Receiving Party shall use Confidential Information
> only to advance the Purpose.

terminates, Receiving Party shall promptly:

> (A)return all materials embodying Confidential Information that
> Disclosing Party provided with request to return; and

> Information.

> (k)**Records Policy**. When this agreement terminates, if Receiving
