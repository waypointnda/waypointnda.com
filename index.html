          If you’re tired of waiting for lawyers to read NDAs,
          or signing terms blind when you know you shouldn't,
          review this form once,
          <a href=#listing>join</a> the <a href=#companies>roster of companies</a>
          who offer and accept it,
          and spread the word.

        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

        <h3 id=special>What’s so special about these NDA terms?</h3>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>The Waypoint NDA differs from other NDAs only in how it protects everyone from having to read it over and over again.  Every copy of The Waypoint NDA comes with a certificate from the side proposing it, guaranteeing that the terms are exactly the same as those published on this site.  The license for the terms requires those who make changes to drop the name “The Waypoint NDA” from their changed versions.</p>

        <h3 id=kind>What kind of NDA is this?</h3>
        <p>These terms are typical of the kinds of terms companies sign before discussing sales, partnerships, and other relatively routine business transactions.</p>
        <p>These terms are <em>not</em> typical of terms companies sign with other companies before mergers-and-acquisitions due diligence or other infrequent, specialized deals.</p>

        <h3 id=improve>Will these terms improve over time?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.</p>
        <p>However, once a version appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  Old versions will remain available.</p>
        <p>If you’s like an e-mail every time a new version comes out, <a href="mailto:kyle@waypointnda.com?subject=Waypoint%20NDA%20Updates%20List">e-mail kyle@waypointnda.com</a> and ask to be added to the mailing list, or subscribe <a href="https://waypointnda.com/versions.xml">via RSS</a>.</p>

        <h3 id=lawyers>Did lawyers write and review this?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  But they are not your lawyers, or responsible to you for legal advice.</p>
        <p>You should have your lawyer review and approve the most recent version.  They can tell you whether and when The Waypoint NDA is right for your company.</p>
        <p>
          If your lawyer has comments, feel free to have them e-mail <a href=mailto:comments@waypointnda.com>comments@waypointnda.com</a>.
          They can also make comments and suggestions to the current version <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNiY8UnePo5GP0kSVD3C7AiWSGhKTYTkrDxuHidB1Qg/edit?usp=sharing">via Google Doc</a>.
          We can and will incorporate feedback.
        </p>

        <h3 id=abroad>Does this NDA work outside the USA?</h3>
        <p>These terms were written with USA-based parties in mind, and require the party proposing the NDA to pick a state of the United States for governing law.</p>
        <p>We’d love to receive comments on whether and how to make it work with other jurisdictions, at <a href=mailto:comments@waypointnda.com>comments@waypointnda.com</a>.</p>

        <h3 id=name>Is this based on the Canting Tribe NDA?</h3>
        <p>The Canting Tribe NDA was renamed The Waypoint NDA in April of 2019.  “Canting Tribe” was a lot more fun, but NDAs aren’t fun, and some but not all users thought a more neutral name would help the NDA spread.</p>
