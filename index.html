        who offer and accept it,
        and spread the word.
        Help avoid and reduce pointless variations of the same old two-way NDA.

        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

        <h3 id=special>What’s so special about these NDA terms?</h3>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>The Waypoint NDA differs from other NDAs in that you only have to read it once.  Every copy of The Waypoint NDA comes with a certificate from the side proposing the NDA, guaranteeing that the terms are exactly the same as those published on this site.</p>

        <h3 id=kind>What kind of NDA is this?</h3>
        <p>These terms are typical of the kinds of terms companies sign before discussing sales, partnerships, and other relatively routine business transactions.</p>
        <p>These terms are <em>not</em> the kind of terms companies sign with other companies before mergers-and-acquisitions due diligence or other infrequent, specialized deals.</p>

        <h3 id=improve>Will these terms improve over time?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.</p>
        <p>However, once a version appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  Old versions will remain available.</p>
        <p>If you would like an e-mail every time a new version comes out, subscribe <a href="https://waypointnda.com/versions.xml">via RSS</a>.</p>

        <h3 id=lawyers>Did lawyers write and review this?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  But <a href=https://notlegaladvice.law>they are not your lawyers, or responsible to you for legal advice</a>.</p>
        <p>You should have your lawyer review and approve the most recent version.  They can tell you whether and when The Waypoint NDA is right for you.</p>
        <p>
          If your lawyer has comments, feel free to have them e-mail <a href=mailto:comments@waypointnda.com>comments@waypointnda.com</a>.
          We’ve incorporated good feedback before, and we’ll gladly do it again.
        </p>

        <h3 id=abroad>Does this NDA work outside the USA?</h3>
        <p>These terms were written for common-law jurisdictions, and require the party proposing the NDA to pick the state, country, or other jurisdiction for governing law.</p>
        <p>United States, Canada, and UK lawyers have reviewed and approved the form. We’re actively seeking similar reads from other common-law legal practitioners:</p>
        <table class=jurisdictions id=jurisdictions>
          <tr><th>Australia</th><td>Pending</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Hong Kong</th><td><a href="mailto:kyle@waypointnda.com?subject=Waypoint%20for%20Hong%20Kong">Get in touch!</a></td></tr>
          <tr><th>India</th><td>Pending</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Israel</th><td>Pending</td></tr>
          <tr><th>Nauru</th><td>Pending</td></tr>
          <tr><th>New Zealand</th><td><a href="mailto:kyle@waypointnda.com?subject=Waypoint%20for%20New%20Zealand">Get in touch!</a></td></tr>
          <tr><th>Singapore</th><td>Pending</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          If you’re a lawyer from a non-US common-law jurisdiction,
          or a client with access to advice from one, download
          <a href=files/waypoint-nda-2.0.0.pdf>the latest version</a>
          and e-mail feedback to
          <a href=mailto:kyle@waypointnda.com>kyle@waypointnda.com</a>.
