        Stop waiting on lawyers to review nondisclosure agreements, or signing terms blind when you know you shouldn’t.
        Review the {{name}} once, sign it many times, and spread the word.
        Help end waste on the same old two-way NDA!

        You can <a href={{latest}}>read the legal terms online</a> and

        There’s also a long-form version that attaches a full copy of the legal terms, instead of incorporating them by reference:

        <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

        <h3 id=special>What’s so special about these NDA terms?</h3>
        <p>Nothing.  The difference is all in handling: how the terms are published, proposed, and agreed.</p>
        <p>The first page of a {{name}} proposal either links to the terms here on {{domain}} or guarantees that the terms attached are the same as those published here.  Once you’ve reviewed a version of the {{name}}, you can propose and receive proposals to sign it over and over, without ever having to review it again.</p>

        <h3 id=using>Is anyone already using the {{name}}?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  Since early 2019, the {{name}} has saved countless hours, dollars, and shreds of precious sanity for executives, employees, and lawyers.  All kinds of companies, from very small to very large, have signed the {{name}}.</p>
        <p>You don’t have to tell us if you use the {{name}}.  But others have shared experiences proposing the {{name}} to companies who already knew about it, leading to zero-review, zero-delay, zero-heartburn signings.</p>

        <h3 id=kind>What kind of NDA is this?</h3>
        <p>{{name}} terms are typical of the kinds of terms companies sign before discussing sales, partnerships, and other relatively routine business transactions.</p>
        <p>The {{name}} is <em>not</em> the kind of NDA companies sign with employees or independent contractors.  For a form of that kind, see <a href=https://squareoneforms.com>Square One</a>.  Nor is the {{name}} the kind of NDA companies sign before mergers-and-acquisitions due diligence or other infrequent, specialized deals.  If you’re interested in a standard pre-M&amp;A NDA, <a href=mailto:{{email}}>send us an e-mail</a>.</p>

        <h3 id=improve>Will these terms improve over time?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.  However, once a version appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  Old versions will remain available.</p>
        <p>You can subscribe to <a href="https://{{domain}}/versions.xml">an RSS feed of new versions</a>, as you would to a feed of new posts to a blog.</p>

        <h3 id=lawyers>Did lawyers write and review the {{name}}?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  <a href=https://notlegaladvice.law>But they are not professionally responsible to you.</a></p>
        <p>If you have access to a lawyer of your own, you should have them review and approve the latest version.  Your lawyer can tell you whether and when the {{name}} is right for you.</p>
        <p>If your lawyer has comments, feel free to have them e-mail <a href=mailto:{{email}}>{{email}}</a>.  We’ve incorporated good feedback before, and we’ll gladly do it again.</p>

        <h3 id=abroad>Does this NDA work outside the USA?</h3>
        <p>Version 1.0.0 of the {{name}} worked only in the United States.  Version 2.0.0 incorporated input from Canadian, British, and Australian lawyers, to work within and between those countries, too.  You can pick the law that will govern your deal, as well as where any lawsuits must take place, on the first page of the {{name}}.</p>
        <p>If you’re a lawyer from another country, or a client with access to advice from one, download <a download="{{name}} {{latest}} Long Form (A4).docx" href=files/{{latest}}-long-a4.docx>the latest version</a> and e-mail feedback or a markup to <a href=mailto:{{email}}>{{email}}</a>.</p>

        <h3 id=promote>How can I help promote the {{name}}?</h3>
        <p>The most important way to promote the {{name}} is to use the {{name}}.  Everyone who receives a {{name}} proposal gets live-action demonstration of how they can save time and hassle.</p>
        <p>Apart from that, spread the word!  Feel free to link to mention {{name}} to friends and colleagues, and to link to {{domain}} on blogs and social media.  If you’d like to share how the {{name}} has helped you or your company, mention <a href=https://twitter.com/{{twitter}}>@{{twitter}}</a> so we can see and share.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to advertise that your company uses and accepts the {{name}}, you can add this badge to your website:</p>
        <figure>
          <a href=https://{{domain}}><img class=badge src=/badge.png alt="Waypoint NDA accepted here"></a>
        </figure>
        <p>You can save this image to your computer, or copy and paste this HTML code:</p>
        <textarea class=code>&lt;a href="https://{{domain}}"&gt;&lt;img src="https://{{domain}}/badge.png" alt="Waypoint NDA accepted here"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</textarea>
